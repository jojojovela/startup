You look through\r all of them and painstakingly have to go through them one by one and look through the\r little details and see which ones you potentially like. You've narrowed it down to 10 pictures \r but that's still a lot. With Photo Voter you can upload those pictures and have your closest friends comment and vote on which they \r like the most. You look at the results and then you can quickly share that post directly to \r your social media like Instagram or Facebook.\r ### Sketches\r ![IMG_5699](https://github.com/jojojovela/startup/assets/156491273/69c22f48-543e-4296-be9b-b6087c65d5a5)\r ![IMG_5701](https://github.com/jojojovela/startup/assets/156491273/911b632a-d8a2-4a38-8ebb-16a0317be459)\r ### Key Features\r - Enhance image of pictures\r - Has number of votes of the picture above it\r - Be able to click on an image and have options (like to vote, comment, or share to social media)\r - Has notifications for when someone comments or votes on your pic\r - Being able to change your vote\r - Being able to upload pictures to application\r ### Technologies\r The following is how I will use the technologies:\r - HTML: I am going to have two webpages, one for login and one for the principal page.
