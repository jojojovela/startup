# First Assignment
I learned how to push and pull between vscode and github and also about writing markdown.
I also learned a lot about resolving conflicts
# Second Assignment
You can stop your server at any time. Don't confuse this with terminating your server which completely destroys it. 
Stopping your server just powers down the device.
It is important to keep the same public IP address so that you, and others, can always browse to the same place. More importantly, when you create your domain name, you can assign it to an address that never changes.
# 3.1 HTML
- always start with <!DOCTYPE html>
- html
  * head
    . title
      - first HTML
  * body
    . Hello World
 - all elements can have attributes associated with them; like <html lang="en">
 - headings and heading numbers can cause it to be smaller.
 - anchor tag references has two types, absolute and relative. Relative is better because more flexibility and don't have to hardcode the url like absolute would.
 # CSS Startup Deliverables
For this deliverable I properly styled the application into its final appearance.

- Header, footer, and main content body - all there and styled appropriately 
- Navigation elements - I added an underline might chnage later on and the hyperlinks work and are styled.
- Responsive to window resizing - My app looks great on all window sizes and devices
- Application elements - I was able to use the whitespace appropriately and a good use of color and contrast
- Application text content - fonts go well with one another 
- Application images - used sample images to portray how it would look and was able to curve the images as well to give more style
